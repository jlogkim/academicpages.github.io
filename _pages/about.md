I'm a MS/PhD student at Visual Computing Lab in SNU with [Hanbyul Joo](https://jhugestar.github.io/). And my research interest is on 3D human reconstruction, motion data recognition and reconstruction (specially regarding human object interaction) and also overall AR/VR fields. I worked as a Backend SW Engineer and Data Engineer in Samsung Bigdata Center 2019.07~2022.01.
