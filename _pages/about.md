Hi! I'm an MS/PhD student at Visual Computing Lab of Seoul National University(SNU) and advised by [Hanbyul Joo](https://jhugestar.github.io/). My research interest is in 3D human motion recognition and reconstruction, especially in human object/scene interaction. I worked as a Backend SW Engineer and Data Engineer in Samsung Bigdata Center 2019.07~2022.01.
